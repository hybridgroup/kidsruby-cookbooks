# KidsRuby Public Cookbooks for Chef

This repository contains KidsRuby's public cookbooks for Chef. This repository is considered "in development." These cookbooks are currently very focused on building the [KidsRuby OS](https://github.com/hybridgroup/kidsruby-os) distribution, but some should be generic enough to use in other projects.
