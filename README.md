# KidsRuby Public Cookbooks for Chef

This repository contains [KidsRuby](http://kidsruby.com)'s public cookbooks for Chef. This repository is considered "in development." These cookbooks are currently very focused on building the [KidsRuby OS](https://github.com/hybridgroup/kidsruby-os) distribution, but some should be generic enough to use in other projects.
